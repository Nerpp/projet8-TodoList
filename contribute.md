How do the pull request

1)	Changing the branch range and destination repository

By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch.

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

2)	Creating the pull request

Create a pull request, use the gh pr create subcommand.
gh pr create

Assign a pull request to me, use the --assignee or -a flags. Important set Your GitHub Displayname.
gh pr create --assignee "@nerpp"

Specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the --base or -B flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the --head or -H flags.
gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch

Include a title and body for the new pull request, use the --title and --body flags.
gh pr create --title "The bug is fixed" --body "Everything works again"

Mark a pull request as a draft, use the --draft flag.
